.SH NAME
\f[CB]libvdeplug_pcap\f[R] \[en] vdeplug module for vde_switch based
networks
.SH SYNOPSIS
libvdeplug_pcap.so
.SH DESCRIPTION
This libvdeplug module interconnects a client to an interface using the
packet capture library (pcap): all the data that is received by this
plug is injected into interface and everything captured from that
interface is sent to the client.
.PP
Please notice that the pcap library captures and injects packets on the
net, packets sent by the host are not captured, injected packets are not
received by the host.
So several clients using libvdeplug_pcap on the same interface of the
same host do not communicate among them (nor they communicate with the
host).
.PP
This module of libvdeplug4 can be used in any program supporting vde
like \f[CB]vde_plug\f[R], \f[CB]vdens\f[R], \f[CB]kvm\f[R],
\f[CB]qemu\f[R], \f[CB]user\-mode\-linux\f[R] and \f[CB]virtualbox\f[R].
.TP
The vde_plug_url syntax of this module is the following:
\f[CB]pcap://\f[R]\f[I]interface_name\f[R]
.SH EXAMPLE
.IP
.EX
vde_plug vde:// pcap://eth0
.EE
.PP
connects the standard vde_switch to the interface eth0.
